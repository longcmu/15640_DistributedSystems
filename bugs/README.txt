This practice assignment is supposed to help you learn to identify bugs more quickly and improve your debugging skills. Hopefully, it might also lead to writing better code with fewer bugs in the first place since you'll know what these types of bugs look like and what to avoid.

The assignment is divided into two pieces: blockingList and packetProcessing. It is recommended that you work on blockingList first as it is easier than packetProcessing. Each of these directories contains a README.txt with more instructions for that part. Generally, you will try to identify what the bug is if there is a bug, or determine that there is no problem. This assignment is not graded and is mainly meant as a study tool to help prepare for the midterm and future projects (both in this class and the workplace).
