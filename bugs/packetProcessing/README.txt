In this problem, you will find 5 go files named 1 through 5. You will work through these in numerical order. These pieces of code try to implement a UDP packet processing system. Starting from 3, it adds the feature to process packets with additional information from the previous (k-1) packets (i.e. every processed packet call has read-only info for the k most recent packets). Now these 5 implementations may or may not have bugs. Your assignment is to identify what the bug is if there is a bug, or determine that there is no problem.
